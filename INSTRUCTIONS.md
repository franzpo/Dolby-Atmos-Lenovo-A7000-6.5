To create your own unity/audmodlib mod, all of the files you need to modify are located in the common folder of this zip (other than the README.md and config.sh)
NOTE: MAKE SURE YOU LEAVE A BLANK LINE AT THE END OF EACH FILE
Further instructions are contained in each file

1. Add your mod info to module.prop
2. Place your files in their respective directories in the system folder (where they will be installed to)
 2a. For apps, place in system/app/APPNAME/APPNAME.apk
 2b. For vendor, just create the vendor folder in the system folder
3. Place any files that need conditionals (only installed in some circumstances) in the custom folder (can be placed however you want)
 3a. Place apps in custom/APPNAME/APPNAME.apk
4. Add your min android version and other variables to common/unity-uservariables.sh (more instructions are in the file)
 4a. Note the Audmodlib variable in this file. Uncomment it if you're making an audio module
5. Add any scripts you want run at boot (late service start in magisk) to common/unity-scripts.sh
6. Modify the post-fs-data.sh in common as you would with any other magisk module (most everything should be a late start, not post-fs-data)
 6a. If post-fs-data is going to be used, set their values to true in config.sh (THESE WILL BE INSTALLED AS REGULAR BOOT SCRIPTS IF NOT A MAGISK INSTALL)
7. Add any build props you want added into the unity-props.prop
8. Add any build props you want removed into the unity-props-remove.prop
9. Add any possibly conflicting files you want removed/wiped before install into the unity-file-wipe.sh
10. Add any config/policy/mixer patches you want added into the aml-patches.sh (audio module only)
11. Add the removal of your patches into the aml-patches-remove.sh (audio module only)
12. Add any other config/policy/mixer patches you want removed/wiped (may conflict with your patches) before install into the aml-patches-wipe.sh (audio module only)
13. Add any custom permissions needed into config.sh (this will apply to both magisk and system installs) (default permissions is 755 for folders and 644 for files)
 13a. DON'T MODIFY ANY OTHER PARTS OF CONFIG.SH (this is different from normal magisk modules)
14. Add any custom install/uninstall logic to unity-customrules1.sh (follow the instructions inside)
 14a. This is where you would put your stuff for any custom files and whatever else isn't taken care of already

*NOTE FOR PATCHING: patches for audio_effects need to be put into both system/etc/audio_effects (CONFIG_FILE) and /vendor/etc/audio_effects (V_CONFIG_FILE)
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

TIMEOFEXEC VALUES - when the customrules file will execute in the (un)installer script

0=File will not be run (default)
1=unity_mod_wipe
2=unity_mod_directory
3=unity_mod_copy
4=aml_mod_patch
5=unity_uninstall

*HINT: If you have props you want set under certain conditions, have that customrule's TIMEOFEXEC=3. Example: unity_prop_copy $INSTALLER/common/customprops.prop
If you have props you want removed under certain conditions, have that customrule's TIMEOFEXEC=1. Example: unity_prop_remove $INSTALLER/common/customprops.prop
